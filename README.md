The tiny bubble-like dots used in Googleâ€™s designs are often referred to as "Google Dots" or "Material Design Dots" in informal contexts. They are a part of Google's Material Design language and are frequently used in animations, loading indicators, or branding elements to signify activity, interactivity, or transitions.

In specific contexts, such as when they appear in loading animations or as interactive elements, they might also be called:

Activity indicators
Loading dots
Motion dots
These dots embody Google's signature use of minimalism, playfulness, and color vibrancy, aligning with its brand identity.
